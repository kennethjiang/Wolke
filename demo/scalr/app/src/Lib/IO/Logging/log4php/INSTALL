 INSTALLATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

1. Before starting installing this package check if the following external
   programs are installed:
   
   a. PHP (version 4.2.x or above). 
      For logging location infos (see src/log4php/spi/LoggerLocationInfo.php)
      for details) a PHP version >= 4.3.0 must be installed
   
2. Extract the tarball to a dir (ex: {YOUR_PATH}).

   If you want to include log4php under an include_path dir 
   consider step (a).

   If you want to include log4php wherever You want consider 
   step (b).

   a. Create a log4php dir under an include_path.
      Copy '{YOUR_PATH}/src/log4php' under an '{an_include_path}/log4php'. 

      define LOG4PHP_DIR as follow (recommended):
   
         define('LOG4PHP_DIR', 'log4php');

      or use directly:

         require_once('log4php/LoggerManager.php');

      LOG4PHP_DIR will be set automatically to '{an_include_path}/log4php' 
      (with path expansion).

   b. Copy '{YOUR_PATH}/src/log4php' to the dir where You want log4php will 
      reside (ex: {MY_LOG4PHP_PATH}).
      Define the constant 'LOG4PHP_DIR' to '{MY_LOG4PHP_PATH}' and use
   
         require_once( LOG4PHP_DIR . '/LoggerManager.php' );

      or directly:

         require_once( '{MY_LOG4PHP_PATH}/LoggerManager.php' );

      and LOG4PHP_DIR will be set automatically with
      '{MY_LOG4PHP_PATH}' (with path expansion).
      
3. That's all!
