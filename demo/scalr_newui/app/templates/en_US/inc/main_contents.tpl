		<h2>What is Scalr?</h2>
		<p>With Scalr, your website and web application can grow to millions of users with little work. Scalr will provision new servers on-the-fly to handle spikes in demand, and decommission them when no longer needed to lower cost. It will scale your database, application servers, and load balancers so you never have to. The end result? With Scalr, you'll never need an $8000/month IT person - just a $99/month subscription to scalr.net</p>
	</div>
	<div class="scalability-for-launch">
		<h2>Scalability for your launch</h2>
		<p>When you’re ready to launch, Scalr will provision all the resources from the Cloud for a smooth product launch, even if a million users sign up the first day. And bonus, if you give us a heads up, we’ll be on stand-by for you.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="scalability-for-growth">
		<h2>Scalability for your growth</h2>
		<p>The hardest part in scaling a website is scaling the database. As your website or application grows, Scalr will scale it automatically by provisioning database slaves, masters, and configuring data replication.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="fault-tolerance">
		<h2>Fault-tolerance, backups, uptime, and efficiency</h2>
		<p>Scalr provides you with a high uptime, fault-tolerant website: Scalr monitors all your servers for crashes, and replaces any that fail. To ensure you never lose any data, Scalr backups your data at regular intervals and uses Amazon EBS for database storage. And to make sure you never pay more than you should, Scalr lowers costs by decommissioning servers when load subsides.</p>
