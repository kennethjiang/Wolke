# Problem? "You must provide a username, eithervia --username or via env[NOVA_USERNAME]"
# Solution = Make sure you have sourced your baschrc file 
# by using the following command
# . ~/.bashrc

# Use the Nova CLI to boot an instance based on our SimpleImage
nova boot --flavor 1 --image 3 myFirstInstance
# List all the instances paying attention to their Status
nova list
# Once the instance is active, ping it's ip Address
ping 10.0.0.3 # Replace with the IP of the instance
# Use the Nova CLI to delete an instance
nova delete 1
# Listing the instance should show that our instance has been deleted
nova list
