                <p align="left">NetCloud Inc. is a cloud-computing based computer hosting  company headquartered in Fremont, California. The company’s primary focus,  although it offers a full array of information technology services, is the  provision of full hosting services to small, medium and emerging companies  looking for state of the industry technology capability at surprisingly low  costs.</p>
                <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
              <p><strong>Our goal  at NetCloud is to help you dramatically reduce your IT budget while  realizing numerous technology and productivity enhancements.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>

                Our Full Service Co-sourcing of Information Technology is  designed to create a more robust and efficient IT function by partnering with our  clients  in order to augment internal  resources in whatever way is needed. Our clients are able to rely on our IT  expertise and resources as a supplement, complement, or replacement for  internal staff. Unlike outsourcing, which would simply move a task or process  out of the organization, co-sourcing brings in additional resources that can be  applied in a flexible manner across the full responsibilities of the IT  function — from technology and transactions to analysis and strategic design.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>From a financial, operating efficiency  and technology perspective, it now makes more sense to &ldquo;plug in&rdquo; to computing  power — just as you connect to the electric grid. In the case of NetCloud, <strong> our clients have experienced  cost savings ranging from 20% to 70%</strong> of current IT budgets after  co-sourcing. Today, capabilities known as &ldquo;Cloud  Computing&rdquo; and &ldquo;Infrastructure as a Service&rdquo; enable organizations to use  processing, storage, networking, security and other fundamental computing  resources without purchasing and maintaining the underlying hardware.  <strong>Typically,</strong> <strong>our fully hosted solutions cost less per  month than half the monthly salary of an IT employee.<br />
                <br />
              </strong>Further,  given numerous environmental concerns, NetCloud can also reduce your data center real estate requirements while driving down power  and cooling costs through economies of scale.<br />
              <br />
                <strong>If you are  interested in exploring the next steps toward improving the performance and  cost- effectiveness, both present and future, of your information technology  resources, please call us at </strong><strong>(888)  229-0183</strong><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
