                      <p align="left"> At    NetCloud, the traditional outsourcing model has been enhanced to    enable our client partners to experience higher control while retaining a    dramatic positive P&amp;L impact. This new sourcing model is asset light, comprehensive    and collaborative. At NetCloud, we refer to our service deployment    model as &ldquo;Full Service Co-Sourcing&rdquo;. Rather than just being a nice marketing    term, let&rsquo;s explain what this means to our client/partners and prospects.    First, a little background into outsourcing versus co-sourcing is    appropriate.<br />
                          <strong><br />
                            NetCloud. Full Service Co-Sourcing versus Outsourcing</strong><br />
  <br />
                        Corporate and IT    leaders today have complex challenges of working on multi-dimensional    strategies to ensure IT solutions deliver mission critical value while    managing risk, compliance, architecture and ever changing technologies. These challenges are    complicated and often lead to distraction from the core business imperatives,    particularly in emerging companies.  </p>
                      <p align="left">                            <br />
                        Consequently, many companies either    investigated or committed their IT resources to outsourcers. But why has    outsourcing failed in so many companies? The results of an extensive study    conducted by the Outsourcing Center are summarized in the chart below.</p>
                      <p align="left"><img src="images/chart.png" width="618" height="505" /></p>
                      <p align="left">Although the reasons    are plentiful, the largest causes of failure can be traced to the following:    communications problems between the outsourcer and the client; poor cultural    match between the companies; and lack of understanding between the parties    and cost/performance. For these reasons and others, NetCloud creates strong working relationships with its clients based on face to face    relationships rather than some form of remote management, often across    multiple time zones. <strong><em>The goal of co-sourcing, as    implemented by NetCloud is more ambitious.</em></strong> </p>
                      <p align="left"><br />
                        NetCloud &rsquo;s Full Service Co-Sourcing of    Information Technology is designed to create a more robust and efficient IT    function by partnering with clients to offer the most optimal level of    economic benefit and technical performance. Although almost all of the IT    systems are hosted at the NetCloud service center, some local    computing capability such as the print server remains on the client&rsquo;s site. Client    / partners who form co-sourcing partnerships with NetCloud are able    to rely on our IT hosting expertise, consulting capabilities and highly    skilled staff to provide additional resources that can be applied in a    flexible manner across the full scope of the IT function.</p>
                      <p align="left"> <br />
                        Since NetCloud offers a packaged set of IT services that most small, medium and    emerging companies typically require, the transition to the NetCloud service center is a simple process that doesn&rsquo;t require significant    management time and attention. The NetCloud technical team has    years of experience in migrating customer data into service centers. In terms    of cost, our monthly hosting cost can be as little as one-half the monthly    cost of an IT senior employee including all hardware, software, licensing    &amp; maintenance. </p>

                      <p>Our approach    is not about &ldquo;winning the deal&rdquo; but establishing long-term mutually    beneficial service relationships.
